# 🧠 SinGAN-Based Image Generation Model

## 📖 Overview

**SinGAN** (Single Image Generative Adversarial Network) is a machine learning model designed to learn the internal patterns of a **single image** and use that to generate diverse outputs. It can be used for image manipulation, texture transfer, super-resolution, and more.

This repository contains a **custom-enhanced version of SinGAN**, which supports not only traditional image inputs but also **CSV files** containing pixel intensity data (for both grayscale and RGB). This makes the model **highly generalizable and suitable for scientific, medical, or tabular image data workflows**.

## 🔧 How SinGAN Works (Multi-Scale Image Generation)

**SinGAN** works by training a sequence of generator-discriminator pairs at multiple image resolutions. These resolutions are referred to as scales: `S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn`.

### 🧱 Multi-Scale Pyramid

- `S0` is the lowest resolution scale, and training starts from here with pure noise.
- Each scale (`Si`) is derived by downsampling the original image using a `scale_factor` (default `0.75`) until reaching `min_scale` (default `25 px`).
- The highest scale (`Sn`) corresponds to the full-size image or up to `max_scale` (default `256 px`).

### 🔁 Progressive Refinement

1. Training begins at `S0`, learning coarse structure from noise.
2. Each higher scale (`S1`, `S2`, ..., `Sn`) adds more detail using the output of the previous scale as input.
3. Controlled noise (`noise_factor`, default `0.1`) is added at each level to promote diversity and learning.

### 🖼️ Final Output

- The final image is generated by **progressively upsampling and refining** the image from `S0` to `Sn`.
- This results in a **high-resolution, realistic image** that captures both global structure and fine details from the original.

## 🔬 Custom Enhancements

> ⚡ **Major Upgrade**  
> This model supports input in the form of both:
> - **Standard image files** (`.jpg`, `.png`)
> - **Pixel intensity CSV files** (for **grayscale and RGB** images)

This makes the model **highly versatile** and expands its applications to:
- Medical and scientific imaging
- Raw sensor data processing
- Tabular-to-visual conversions

## ▶️ How to Run the Model

### 📥 Step 1: Download the Repository
Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local machine.

### ⚙️ Step 2: Set Up Conda Environment
Make sure **Conda** is installed. If not, download and install [Miniconda or Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### 🧑‍💻 Step 3: Open Project in VS Code
- Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
- Use the built-in terminal (`View > Terminal`).

### 📦 Step 4: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install required libraries:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📁 Step 5: Add Input Files
- Place input **images** in the `images/` folder  
- Place **CSV files** in the `csv data/` folder

### 🏁 Step 6: Run the Model
Use one of the following commands:

- **For image input:**
```bash
python generation/main.py --root "images/your_image.jpg"
```

- **For CSV input:**
```bash
python generation/main.py --root "csv data/your_file.csv"
```

### 🖼️ Step 7: View Results
- A new folder named `results/` will be created.
- Generated images across different scales will be saved there.
